# OPC-UA Examples

OPC-UA examples for
[Real Time Logic's OPC-UA stack](https://realtimelogic.com/products/opc-ua/).

OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a machine to machine
communication protocol for industrial automation.

The examples are designed to be run using the
[pre-compiled Mako Server](https://makoserver.net/download/overview/),
which includes the OPC-UA plugin. Run any of the examples,
using the Mako Server, as follows (unless stated otherwise):

```shell
mako -l::Directory-Name
```

Directory-Name is the name of the example's source code directory. See the
[Mako Server command line video tutorial](https://youtu.be/vwQ52ZC5RRg)
for more information on how to start the Mako Server. See the
[Getting Started with the Mako Server](https://makoserver.net/documentation/getting-started/)
command line guide for additional instructions.
